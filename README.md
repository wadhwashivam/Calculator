# Calculator Project

Welcome to the Calculator project! This is a simple and functional calculator that provides essential mathematical operations along with some additional features like All Clear, Backspace, Percentage, Brackets, and a unique display that keeps track of both the input and output simultaneously.


## Live Demo

You can try the calculator by visiting the [Live Demo](https://wadhwashivam.github.io/Calculator/) here.

## Features

- **All Clear (AC):** Clears both the input and output fields.
- **Backspace (⌫):** Removes the last character from the input.
- **Percentage (%):** Calculates the percentage of the current input value.
- **Brackets ( ):** Supports the use of parentheses for complex expressions.
- **Operators:** Provides basic arithmetic operators - addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
- **Comma Separation:** Automatically adds commas to large numbers for better readability.

## Getting Started

To use this calculator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.

3. Open `index.html` in a web browser to launch the calculator.

## Usage

- Enter your mathematical expressions using the calculator's buttons or your keyboard.
- Use the AC button to clear both the input and output fields.
- The Backspace button (⌫) allows you to delete the last character in the input.
- The Percentage button (%) calculates the percentage of the current input.
- Use parentheses to create complex expressions.
- Basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) are provided for mathematical operations.
- The calculator automatically adds commas to large numbers in the output for better readability.

## Example Expressions
